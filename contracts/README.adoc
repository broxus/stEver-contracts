= StEver Staking Platform

[.readme-notice]
NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.stever.com

The StEver staking platform is a comprehensive and robust system designed for efficient and secure staking of ever tokens. It incorporates a suite of contracts and interfaces that work together to facilitate token staking, management of validators and strategies, and handling of withdrawal requests.

The StEver platform is composed of a set of core components, abstract contracts, and interfaces that define and implement the necessary functionalities.

TIP: For an overview of the StEver staking platform and a walkthrough on how to interact with the contracts, read our xref:README.adoc[Quick Start].


== Core Components

{StEverVault}: is the central contract of the StEver staking platform. It aggregates all validators, manages staking, and issues StEver tokens. Users can deposit their ever tokens into the StEverVault, and in return, they receive StEver tokens. Withdrawal requests are also processed by the StEverVault.

{StEverAccount}: Each user has an associated StEverAccount which tracks their withdrawal requests. A user can initiate a withdrawal from the StEverVault, creating a withdrawal request in their StEverAccount.

{StEverCluster}: The StEverCluster contract aggregates strategies owned by a validator. Validators who wish to participate in the StEver project must have a StEverCluster contract created for them by the StEver admins.

{DepoolStrategyFactory}: The DepoolStrategyFactory contract is used to create new Depool strategies.

{StrategyDePool}: The StrategyDePool is an abstraction that represents a connector to the `DePool` contract. It's part of the system that manages strategies for the StEver staking platform.

{Platform}: The Platform contract is responsible for managing the entire StEver staking platform.

== Abstract Contracts

{StEverStrategiesManager}: The StEverStrategiesManager contract is used to manage the strategies for the StEver staking platform.

{StEverVaultBase}: The StEverVaultBase contract is the base for the StEverVault contract and other related contracts.

{StEverVaultEmergency}: The StEverVaultEmergency contract is used to handle emergency situations in the StEverVault.

{StEverVaultStorage}: The StEverVaultStorage contract is a storage contract for the StEverVault.

{StEverVaultStrategiesController}: The StEverVaultStrategiesController contract manages strategies in the StEverVault.

{StEverVaultValidators}: The StEverVaultValidators contract extends the StEverVaultBase contract with functions that validate deposit and withdrawal requests.

== Interfaces

{IDePool}: The interface represents the DePool contract, which is a part of the StEver staking platform.

{IDePoolStrategy}: The interface represents the DePool Strategy contract.

{IDepoolStrategyFactory}: The interface represents the DePool Strategy Factory contract.

{IParticipant}: The interface represents a participant in the DePool staking platform.

{IStEverAccount}: The interface defines the necessary functionality required by the StEverAccount contract.

{IStEverCluster}: The interface defines the essential functionality required by the StEverCluster contract.

{IStEverVault}: The interface defines the necessary functions for depositing and withdrawing ever tokens.

{IStrategy}: The interface defines the essential functionalities required by a strategy in the StEver staking platform.

The {StEverVault} contract is the central point of the StEver staking platform. It aggregates all validators, handles staking, and issues StEver tokens. Users can deposit their ever tokens into the StEverVault and receive StEver tokens in return. Withdrawal requests are also processed by the StEverVault.

StEverVault is based on abstractions such as:

  - {StEverVaultStorage}
  - {StEverVaultBase}
  - {StEverStrategiesManager}
  - {StEverVaultEmergency}
  - {StEverVaultStrategiesController}
  - {StEverVaultValidators}

that add additional functionality to the basic StEverVault contract.
